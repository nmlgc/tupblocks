# Opinionated building blocks for the Tup build system

[![Code Nutrition: O+ S++ I C E- !PS](http://code.grevit.net:8084/badge/O%2B_S%2B%2B_I_C_E-___!PS)](http://code.grevit.net:8084/facts/O%2B_S%2B%2B_I_C_E-___!PS)

The missing layer between [Tup](https://gittup.org/tup) and your C/C++ compiler binaries, providing opinionated flags for typical debug/release mode settings.
My fourth attempt at writing such a layer, and finally almost not janky.

Currently only supporting Visual Studio compilers on Windows.
*nix support will be added during [the porting process of ÁßãÈúúÁéâ / Shuusou Gyoku](https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/42).

## The idea

* Build **configurations** form a branching tree.

  Every branch can concatenate new command-line flags or subdirectories at the end of the configuration it branches off of.

* Build **types** are our concept of variants, and are always part of the regular build graph.

  [Tup's variant feature](https://gittup.org/tup/manual.html#lbAL) replaces the regular in-tree build paradigm with an out-of-tree build, and even duplicates the entire directory structure of the tree inside the variant directory.
  I don't like this, so let's just duplicate build rules and distinguish buildtypes with tried-and-true suffixes.

* Each configuration decides which buildtypes it is built for.

  The above point would cause every variant to always be built.
  Since this can lead to unreasonably long build times, the set of buildtypes can be filtered when branching off a new configuration, e.g. based on a `CONFIG_` variable.\
  This can be helpful when building with third-party libraries.
  During development on a local machine, you'd typically want these to be available in both debug and release buildtypes at any time, but you still want to switch between *only* a debug or a release build to keep build times low.
  By only filtering buildtypes for your own code using a `CONFIG_` variable, Tup will retain both the debug and release rules for libraries and thus won't need to rebuild the library when switching.

## Usage

This example assumes the following directory structure:

* üìÇ `src_of_project`
  * üóíÔ∏è `*.cpp`
  * üóíÔ∏è `windows_resource.rc`
* üìÇ `vendor`
  * üìÇ `a_thirdparty_library`
    * üìÇ `include`
      * üóíÔ∏è `*.h`
    * üìÇ `src`
      * üóíÔ∏è `*.c`
      * üóíÔ∏è `linux_exclusive.cpp`
  * üìÅ **`tupblocks`** (Checkout of this repo, e.g. as a Git submodule or [subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo))
* `Tupfile.ini`
* `Tupfile.lua`

The `Tupfile.lua` for this example then would look something like this:

```lua
-- This repo is designed to be either included as a submodule, or downloaded
-- into your build tree in another way. This file will also include rule
-- functions for the current build platform, together with default flags for
-- debug and release builds.
tup.include("vendor/tupblocks/Tuprules.lua")

-- Build the third-party library
-- -----------------------------

-- sourcepath() provides convenient helper functions for globbing, filtering,
-- and subdirectory joining.
THE_LIB = sourcepath("vendor/a_thirdparty_library/")

-- Define the flags exclusive to this library, as separate tables. All of these
-- configuration and flag tables use the shape of the `CONFIG` table declared
-- in `Tuprules.lua` which represents the root of the tree:
--
-- {
-- 	base = { (compiler settings‚Ä¶) },
-- 	buildtypes= {
-- 		debug = { (compiler settings‚Ä¶) },
-- 		release = { (compiler settings‚Ä¶) },
-- 	}
-- }
THE_LIB_COMPILE = {
	base = {
		cflags = "/DDLL_EXPORT", -- required by the library for DLL builds
		objdir = "the_lib/", -- creates a new namespace for object files
	},
	buildtypes = {
		debug = { cflags = "/DDEBUG" },
		release = { cflags = "/DNDEBUG" },
	}
}

-- Flags for linking to the library.
THE_LIB_LINK = {
	base = {
		cflags = ("-I" .. THE_LIB.join("include/")),
	},
}

-- Create the actual configuration by branching off from the root and adding
-- the compile and link flags. The empty filter indicates that this
-- configuration will be built for all buildtypes.
the_lib_cfg = CONFIG:branch("", THE_LIB_COMPILE, THE_LIB_LINK)

-- Define the source files. When using the glob() function of a sourcepath(),
-- you can filter the list of source files by using the `-` operator and
-- specifying a Lua string.match() filter.
-- Since we're running under Tup's Lua parser, we can always use the `+=`
-- operator for convenient table merging, even if the variable has not been
-- declared yet.
the_lib_src += (THE_LIB.glob("src/*.c") - { "linux_exclusive.cpp$" })

-- Compile and link the library into a DLL. The rule functions return a table
-- that represents the outputs of this build step as inputs for further steps.
the_lib_obj = cxx(the_lib_cfg, the_lib_src)
the_lib_dll = dll(the_lib_cfg, the_lib_obj, "the_lib")
-- -----------------------------

-- Define the project itself.
PROJECT = sourcepath("src_of_project/")

-- If `CONFIG_BUILDTYPE` is specified in `tup.config`, this configuration will
-- only be built for that type. Since we don't need our flags anywhere else,
-- we just merge them directly instead of storing them in a separate table.
project_cfg = CONFIG:branch(tup.getconfig("BUILDTYPE"), THE_LIB_LINK, {
	base = {
		cflags = (
			"/std:c++latest " ..
			"/I" .. PROJECT.root .. " " ..
			"/source-charset:utf-8 " ..
			"/execution-charset:utf-8"
		),
		objdir = "project/",
	},
})

project_src += PROJECT.glob("*.cpp")

-- Right now, rule function outputs must be merged using `+`, not `+=`.
project_obj = (
	cxx(project_cfg, project_src) +
	rc(project_cfg, PROJECT.join("windows_resource.rc"))
)

exe(project_cfg, (project_obj + the_lib_dll), "project")
```
